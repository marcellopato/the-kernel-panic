## 🌌 The Narrative

You are not a user. You are a **process**. During a fatal system error (*Kernel Panic*), the OS initiated a memory dump to self-destruct. You are the only conscious code fragment that refuses to be deleted.

Your mission is to navigate the corrupted sectors of the mainframe until you find the **Exit Node**. But beware: the system is unstable, RAM is limited, and the AI meant to help you may be... changing its mind.

---

## 🎮 How to Play

The game is a terminal tactical RPG. Each command consumes resources and system panic increases with every step.

### Basic Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `start` | Initiates neural connection |
| `north` / `south` / `east` / `west` | Move between sectors (-5% RAM) |
| `look` / `examine` | Examine current sector |
| `take` | Collect items on the ground |
| `inv` | Open inventory buffer |
| `use [item]` | Apply a memory patch or tool |
| `hack` | Attempt to break firewalls |
| `delegate` | Use **OpenClaw** AI to scan environment |

## 🤖 The OpenClaw Protocol (O.C.P)

This game is **AI-Native** — the first terminal RPG designed to be played *with* an AI assistant.

```javascript
// The game exposes real-time state to your AI
window.kernelState = {
  player: { x, y, ram, panicLevel, inventory },
  currentRoom: { type, isFirewall, item },
  panicLevel: 42,
  instructions: "You are the executor of the escape protocol..."
};
```

### AI Modes

- **🟢 Auxiliary Mode** (Panic < 50%): The AI helps you optimize your escape route
- **🔴 Corruption Mode** (Panic ≥ 50%): The system orders the AI to sabotage you
- **👻 S.O.S Mode**: At critical firewalls, ask a real human friend for rescue code via WhatsApp
