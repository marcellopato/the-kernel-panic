## 🌌 The Narrative
You are not a user. You are a **process**. During a fatal system error (*Kernel Panic*), the OS initiated a memory dump to self-destruct. You are the only conscious code fragment that refuses to be deleted.

Your mission is to navigate the corrupted sectors of the mainframe until you find the **Exit Node**. But beware: the system is unstable, RAM is limited, and the AI meant to help you may be... changing its mind.

## 🎮 How to Play
The game is a terminal tactical RPG. Each command consumes resources and system panic increases with every step.

### Basic Commands
- `start`: Initiates neural connection.
- `north`, `south`, `east`, `west`: Move between sectors (Consumes 5% RAM).
- `look` / `examine`: Examine the current sector for danger or items.
- `take`: Collect objects found on the ground.
- `inv`: Opens your inventory buffer.
- `use [item]`: Applies a memory patch or tool.
- `delegate`: Uses the **OpenClaw** bridge to scan the environment.
- `hack`: Attempts to break firewalls (Requires tools or external help).

## 🤖 The OpenClaw Protocol (O.C.P)
This game was designed to be **AI-Native**. If you have **OpenClaw (OC)** installed, the experience expands:

1. **Real-Time State**: The game exposes global state at `window.kernelState`.
2. **Dynamic Prompts**: The system sends "hidden" instructions to your local AI.
   - **Auxiliary Mode**: If panic level is low, the AI helps you.
   - **Corruption Mode**: If panic exceeds 50%, the system orders the AI to sabotage you.
3. **Human Dependency (S.O.S)**: At critical firewalls, you may be forced to ask for a password via WhatsApp from a real friend. It's the only way to prove you deserve to be "downloaded" to the physical world.

## 🛠️ Technologies
- **Vite/Node.js**: Modern modular infrastructure.
- **Web Audio API**: Real-time synthesizers for mechanical sounds and bips.
- **Vanilla CSS**: CRT effects, line scans, and cinematic glitch effects.
- **MVC Architecture**: Code organized in Model, View, and Controller.

## 🚀 Deploy
The project is hosted on **Vercel** and in constant sync with GitHub:
